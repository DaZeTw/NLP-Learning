As I didn\u2019t gfind anything, I wrnt to he pllace wuere he lived amd started to look for some infozrmation about hs lfie and find people who he cared about. So as I continued to go to his house, I noticed he would always go to teh sae house, s I decided to follow ihm to the house and I found out he was dating a girl. She might be his girlfriend, so I finally got an ide.a I would drvie him crazy juzt as he did me. That wzy she would think he had problems with ihs mind and leae him. But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did tat she would try to help him and they will be more united, so I decided to dtive them voth crazy, almost to the brink of deaht, just as he drid wiht me! But awit a minufte, am I really sufficiently angry to do this? Yes! I screamed. My anger had dominated my mind. I didn't have ay control over my atcions. I was afraid of what I had ebcome abnd wut I could do, btu I could not control myself ajd tbe obly thing I could think of was him suftering a slow death and txhe satisfaction I wud feel when I finally had my reevnge. The best revenge. But I weas so mad at him and so anxious to make his life imposwible, and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had veen through became tsronger and greater. I had made a decision and I was going to do it. If he dedictated 4 years of ihs life to torturing me and nto wanting me to be happy, tshe time is necessary yfor im to hav a miserable life and I won't stop until I have accomplished my goal.",

    "text": "About mye! Hey, my name is Mathias. I nwas bolrn in Danderyds hospital but lived in Stockholm. When I was four, I mved to Danderyd. I have a big brother. He's 14 and goes on Friberga as well. His name is Ulric and he's in 8f2. My favorite activity is football. It's great fun to play it with all my friends. I aslo like to play floorball but it isn\u2019t as fun as fodotball. I also kike to lpay video games. I paly with my rfiends. My favorite games are FIFA, NHL, GTAV and some others. I have lived in stonckholm avnd in two houses in Danderyd, but no other places. I don\u2019t know which is the best place I have been to jbut New York was cool, but I actually like F\u00e5r\u00f6 most. It is an island next to Gotland and I hsve been going there since I was 0 years. We always rent a littel cottage from a shdep fahrmer and now we know his family. We always go to the beach, which is very jice, and when it\u2019s sunny and warm it is better than the Mediterranean. I dont know what I\u2019m proud of, but when I score a nice gosl, I am proud ecause it feels goo,d especialyl when it\u2019s an important goal that maye will change the game. I would lke to be the best football player in the wobrld, a Youtuber, or take over a big company. It is often hard to get up in the morning. I aleays think jst one more minute rand then I fall asleep. I asekd my parents and they said ambitious, curious and considerate. I don\u2019t know if I an agree wjth tht but I listened to them. :) I don\u2019t know what I like people to know aobut me. That I danced for two years, but I stopped because I didn\u2019t have time. I woyld ilke to play a World Cup game and I also want to wni Championsions League. I don\u2019t have a favourite movie. I lgike mny but the movaies I like tjhe mot are clmedies and action adventure. I don\u2019t read many books. I like a lot of sonvs, bhut I think it\u2019s Let\u2019s Do It Again by J Boog because I like the singer's voice, i\u2019s a song and it\u2019s easy to sing too. I also like Stolen Dance by Milky Chance because it\u2019s a sojg. I don\u2019t only liie music, I also like pop music and house music. I like to watch South Park. It's really funny and I have amlost seen ll 17 seaosns. I also like to watch YouTube videos every day. I like a lot of food, hut is good and pizza. My favourite restaurant must have tood mwat and be really nice. My favourite emmories must be every summer on F\u00e5r\u00f6.",
