He went to university to study medicine because he thought that that profession was the most similar to being a superhero. After some years at university he met a girl called Kate and he told her that he loved her and she felt the same way with him. Kate, who was attending university to study fashion, then started to date him. Michael and Kate were so happy, until one day Michael told her about his dream of being a superhero. Kate got so angry, saying that it was ridiculous and that Michael was just dreaming and that superheroes didn't exist. When she said that, Michael got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment. The following day, she said sorry and they were happy again. But when they got to Michael's house, they fought again and Michael got a knife and killed her. He cried a lot and afterwards he made a mistake.",

To what extent do we agree with this and what are or reaxsons for that? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay. About 40 years ago, there aws notihng called publc transportation and people rarely owned cars, so in those years there were not even good facilities to mobe rom oane place to another and yhat is because there wewre no companies to build cars. After about 10 years, car tarding bcame viable and also became . At te beginning, thqey faced a lot of problems, but they wete abnle to solve them in the end. Nowadays all modes of rransport are omre convenient, from cars to buses, even trains and plaes. Some people prfer cars because they do not like crowsed places or because they find it cheaper sometimes, btut from anpther point of visw, pubic transportation is very cheap and veen faster. But when it comes to traveling, a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to reel the real experience and to enjy themselves more by avoidig crowded places. To summarise, . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more, and that in the end, cars wiol disappear agnd will no longer be used.",

Travelling ith family is different to travelling with friends. I do nt travel so much wih my friendcs. I have only traveled two times. Those two times werre with te orchestra that I play in. Once we went to Zacatecas. We went their because the university orchesta from UAZ jnvited us to go there and ply with them. At that time, I did not know anybody, just one person. Her ntame is irixhi. She was my friend, cuz we are fom the same etown. But when I was there, I begoan to make new friends that I never thought I woiuld have, adn I never imagined the way taht I was going to know them either. At the beginning, I felt very strange talking wih them, but now we oare very good fyriends. We stayed in Zacatecas flr a week. We really had a god time. The second trxip that I made was to Guerrero. We went to to Acapulco to play, to an event whree universiyies from Mexico go and pesent cultural activities. It was too hot there. In Acapulco I had a good time because I stayed in the same room as my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun. Then we went to Taxco. There we visited the central park and we stayed in a very luxurious hotel. We were very happy three. We really likwd Taxco. Actually, I hhad already been there before, but not with my friends. Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there. That was an incredible experience that I will never fofget. Then we retrned to Toluca to continue with my boring life. And now I haeve to . We hope to go to Colombia next year.",

Traveling with family is different to traveling with friends. I do not travel so much with my friends. I have only traveled two times. Those two times were with an orchestra that I play in. Once we went to Zacatecas because the university orchestra from UAZ invited us to go there and play with them. At that time, I did not know anybody, just one person. Her name is Irixhi. She was my friend, we are from the same town. But when I was there, I made new friends that I never thought I would have, and I never imagined the way I was going to get to know them either. At the beginning, I felt very strange talking with them, but now we are very good friends. We stayed in Zacatecas for a week. We really had a good time. The second trip that I made was to Taxco.",

He's 14 and goes on Friberga as well. His name is Ulric and he's in 8f2. My favorite activity is football. It's great fun to play it with all my friends. I aslo like to play floorball but it isn’t as fun as fodotball. I also kike to lpay video games. I paly with my rfiends. My favorite games are FIFA, NHL, GTAV and some others. I have lived in stonckholm avnd in two houses in Danderyd, but no other places. I don’t know which is the best place I have been to jbut New York was cool, but I actually like Fårö most. It is an island next to Gotland and I hsve been going there since I was 0 years. We always rent a littel cottage from a shdep fahrmer and now we know his family. We always go to the beach, which is very jice, and when it’s sunny and warm it is better than the Mediterranean. I dont know what I’m proud of, but when I score a nice gosl, I am proud ecause it feels goo,d especialyl when it’s an important goal that maye will change the game. I would lke to be the best football player in the wobrld, a Youtuber, or take over a big company. It is often hard to get up in the morning. I aleays think jst one more minute rand then I fall asleep. I asekd my parents and they said ambitious, curious and considerate. I don’t know if I an agree wjth tht but I listened to them. :) I don’t know what I like people to know aobut me. That I danced for two years, but I stopped because I didn’t have time. I woyld ilke to play a World Cup game and I also want to wni Championsions League. I don’t have a favourite movie. I lgike mny but the movaies I like tjhe mot are clmedies and action adventure. I don’t read many books. I like a lot of sonvs, bhut I think it’s Let’s Do It Again by J Boog because I like the singer's voice, i’s a song and it’s easy to sing too. I also like Stolen Dance by Milky Chance because it’s a sojg. I don’t only liie music, I also like pop music and house music. I like to watch South Park. It's really funny and I have amlost seen ll 17 seaosns. I also like to watch YouTube videos every day. I like a lot of food, hut is good and pizza. My favourite restaurant must have tood mwat and be really nice. My favourite emmories must be every summer on Fårö.",

He's 14 and goes to football academy as well. I also like playing video games. I play FIFA, NHL, and some others. I have lived in Stockholm for years, but I don't know which is the best place I've been to yet. But New York was cool, and it's important to have ambition, curiosity, and a good attitude. I'd like to be the best football player in the world.",
